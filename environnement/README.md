Neural MMO is a massively multiagent environment for artificial intelligence research inspired by Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) role-playing games. The project is under active development with major updates every 3-6 months. This README is a stub -- all of our [Documentation](https://neuralmmo.github.io "Neural MMO Documentation") is hosted by github.io.
