One of:

**Insufficient**: Something is documented, but the current documentation is inadequate

**Missing**: Something is undocumented. Note that most internal functions should be considered self-documenting -- consider submitting an enhancement report for refactoring if they are not.

**Other**: Something else. We will update this template to include your problem category afterwards.
