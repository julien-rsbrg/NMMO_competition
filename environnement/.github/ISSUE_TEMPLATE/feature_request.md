Eventually, feature requests will be treated as a scrum board for open-source contributors. At the current scale, you should come chat with us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/BkMmFUC) #development channel before writing one of these.

**I am trying to:** Describe your use case. What is the end result you would like to achieve?

**It is hard/impossible because:" Is this a core missing feature? Is Neural MMO structured in a way that makes what you are trying to do unnecessarily hard? Is documentation missing or confusing?

**The solution should look like:** Describe your ideal solution --  a requirement, an API, a restructuring, additional documentation, etc.
