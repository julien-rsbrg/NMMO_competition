This is what you want to opimize.

Optimizing this system is the whole point of what we are doing.

This is a file supposed to contain code about your environment. Its existence has 2 reason :
1) It will contain the main part of the code that will be used to get the env working.
2) It should not implement any particular hierarchization of tasks in itself. It is the duty of multiagent_env, not of this file.
